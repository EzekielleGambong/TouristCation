It is about 4 tiers that cascades down at different heights. The main cascade which is at the top most level is made of 3 main separated cascades. It was very hard to get to the base of the main cascades as it is obstructed by large boulders and very slippery. The place offers a great picnic area and an enjoyable dip to its rushing clear waters in the natural pools and in its cascades. Fill your lungs with its  fresh air, sleep under the trees, and you can also take a plunge in a river downhill near the waterfalls.",

Its giant branches are covered with moss, fern, and other aerial plants giving it a green complexion instead of the usual brown and dark gray color.
